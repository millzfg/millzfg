- 👋 Hi, I’m @millzfg or just millz will do.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming languages and how they power the devices we all use today.
      Not to mention how programming ties into cybersecurity. I think it is all so fascinating! I guess a big question is why am I just now making a Github lol.
      Well to be honest I have always had my doubts. But I'm here now and ready to learn and devour all information in sight.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity programming language. I mean who doesn't know about cryptocurrency and its wonderful technology. I mean most of us have probably
      lost quite a bit of money by now unfortunately. But cryptocurrency isn't going anywhere, it just caught a snag, and once it gets free it's on!
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything I can gain experience or learn. I have dabbled in a bit of Java, Javascript, and Python so I know a little
      something but I'm open to learning more.
      
- 📫 How to reach me? Well I guess here is the best place to reach me as of now. Send me a message or however the communication works on here, I'll figure it out and
      get back to you in a timely fashion.
